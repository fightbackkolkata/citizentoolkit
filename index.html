                <h1>Stop the Eviction of Hawkers in Kolkata!</h1>
                <p>We are at a critical juncture where the livelihoods of our fellow hawkers in Kolkata are under threat. The recent eviction orders targeting these hardworking individuals undermine not just their right to earn a living but also the vibrant character of our city. As concerned citizens, it is our duty to stand in solidarity against such unjust measures.</p>
